# objmc-rs

> A *blazingly fast* ðŸš€ rewrite of objmc's CLI/generator.
> More info about the spec and shader can be found in the [original repository.](https://github.com/godlander/objmc)

## Current Features

objmc-rs is relatively new and isn't as fully featured as the original Python version. Below is a list of complete and incomplete features.

- [ ] Commands
  - [x] `convert` - takes an input model and texture and produces an output
  - [x] `join` - join multiple models together
  - [ ] `head` - creates a skull texture
- [ ] Generation
  - [x] Multiple models/textures
  - [x] Settings header
  - [x] Texture inversion
  - [x] Position/UV data generation
  - [x] Offset & scale
  - [ ] Compression

## Usage

The CLI is built with GitHub Actions, which can be found [here](https://github.com/oglassdev/objmc-rs/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=is%3Acompleted).

Download the appropriate version for your OS and architecture, unarchive it, and use it. This must be used as a CLI application and will appear to not do anything if run by double clicking it.

> [!WARNING]
> As reported by Godlander, the executable may be falsely detected as a trojan by Microsoft Defender if run on Windows.

> This is a common false positive with Rust programs on Windows, and can be safely ignored. I personally have been unable to reproduce it, so it may vary depending on what Defender version you may be on. If you have security concerns and would still like to verify that it is safe, you are welcome to upload it to VirusTotal.

### Convert Usage

Currently, this is the only implemented CLI command. This takes input OBJs and textures, then creates an output.

```bash
objmc convert [OPTIONS] --obj <OBJ> --texture <TEXTURE> <OUTPUT_MODEL> <OUTPUT_TEXTURE>
```

#### Arguments

| **Argument/Option**           | **Description**                                                           | **Default**                        |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `--texture-resource <STRING>` | Resource reference in the model JSON. Defaults to the output texture.     | `None`                             |
| `-o, --obj <OBJ>`             | Input OBJ model file(s).                                                  | Required.                          |
| `-t, --texture <TEXTURE>`     | Input texture file(s).                                                    | Required.                          |
| `--offset <X Y Z>`            | Offset applied to the model.                                              | `None` (no offset).                |
| `--scale <X Y Z>`             | Scaling factors for the model in the x, y, and z directions.              | `None` (no scaling).               |
| `--duration <NUMBER>`         | Duration of the animation in ticks.                                       | `0`                                |
| `--fade-textures`             | Whether to interpolate between texture frames.                            | `true`                             |
| `--easing <EASING>`           | Easing function for animations (e.g., `linear`, `ease-in-out`, `bezier`). | `None`                             |
| `--colorbehavior <BEHAVIORS>` | Defines color overlay behaviors (e.g., `pitch`, `yaw`, `roll`).           | `["pitch", "yaw", "roll"]`         |
| `--autorotate-yaw`            | Attempt to estimate yaw rotation using normals.                           | `false`                            |
| `--autorotate-pitch`          | Attempt to estimate pitch rotation using normals.                         | `false`                            |
| `-c, --compress`              | Compress output.                                                          | `false`                            |

| `--flip-uv`                   | Invert the texture to adjust for flipped UV mapping.                      | `false`                            |
| `--autoplay`                  | Always interpolate animations, overriding `time`-based color behavior.    | `false`                            |
| `--visibility <VISIBILITY>`   | Determines model visibility (e.g., `gui`, `first-person`, `world`).       | `["gui", "first-person", "world"]` |

 For more info, run
```bash
 objmc convert -h
```

Alternatively, a config file can be used with the `--config` option.

```
objmc convert --config config.json
```

[Configuration Example](./config.example.json)

#### Examples

1. **Basic Conversion**
   ```bash
   objmc convert -o model.obj -t texture.png model.json texture_out.png
   ```

2. **Multiple Models/Textures**
